        <h1>Discussion</h1>
        <p>Our overall goal was to identify what references each president mentioned, and then identify possible patterns leading to this conclusion.</p>
        <p>The "Length of References Per Speech" graph counts every character of each reference. This includes letters, puncuation, and spaces. Now what speeches 
        contained the highest amount of characters for each reference? James Madison's second speech contained the most characters pertaining to war at 5,817. We believe 
        this is because of the War of 1812. His second speech was during the year 1813, so at the start of the war. He focuses on reasons for fighting Great Britain and boosting 
        moral in the states. The longest social reference is from William Hengry Harrison at 9,798 characters. This is because he talks about inbalance of power in the government 
        and unequal treatment of the people. James Monroe has the longest diplomacy reference in his second speech at 6,586 characters. This is during the conclusion of the War 
        of 1812 so he talks about the relationship between the States and Great Britain concluding the war. The longest economy reference is 9,911, from William 
        McKinley's first speech. He talks a lot about the government's income from taxes, the gold and silver price, and the general state of the working world. The religion 
        reference was the lowest reference on average because it is most common in the closing remarks of a speech. Abraham Lincoln's second speech had the longest characters 
        about religion at 1,794. This is because he cites pages from the Bible, about God judging men on their actions, in this case slavery. This is odd because Lincoln was not 
        very religious growing up, and he was the only president not a member of the church.</p>
        <p>High reference counts usually directly correlate to current events happeing during the president's campaigning period. They focus on what the citizens are talking about 
        and emphasize them in their speeches for votes. One thing to notes is a speech having low references, and what this really means. George Washington's second speech did not 
        contain any references, and this was not an error he just did not mention any references we were looking for. On average, a lower reference count means that there was no 
        current events pertaining to that reference. Another reason could be that the president't focus was somewhere else. For example, Harry S. Truman focused on diplomacy 
        the most because it was the end of World War 2. He would be focusing on the relationships between the other countries.</p>
        <p>The "Percentage of Speech" graph counts the characters of each reference then divides it by the total characters of the speech. This percentage shows a more accurate 
        number of what the president was focusing on. A president can fill their speech with nothing associated to the references, this really shows how much they talked about 
        a reference regardless of how many characters it is. A higher total percentage says that the speaker is straight to the point. Another thing we can pull from this graph is 
        patterns of each reference. A high percentage of one refernce across multiple speeches reveals a reocurring theme. An example of this would be the hight social percentage 
        from Obama's first speech to today. This because of the Covid-19 Pandemic, and the recent movement of equal rights. During the Ronald Reagan Era, his two speeches show 
        spikes in the economy reference. This makes sense because of his pro-business views involving lower taxes and increased military spending concluding the Cold War. Speaking 
        of the Cold War, a consistent spike of diplomacy references appear from Truman to Carter, besides Lyndon B. Johnson. He still mentions Communism and their relationship 
        with Russia, just not to the extent of the others. This could be because he had a shorter speech, but a shorter speech could've led to a higher percent. He just did not 
        go in depth about the Cold War. Another pattern is a higher percentage of social references from Grant to Benjamin Harrison. This is because of the end of the Civil War. 
        These presidents talk about social equality, and the lack of progression from the southern states. Even after the war was won, each president emphasized the importance 
        of equality among men.</p>
        <p>Each speech shows us a timeline of events that the United States was experiencing. A feature we would like added possibly in the future would be each president's 
        political party, and how that correlates with each reference. Then you can show which party prioritized each reference. Another thing would be to derive a timeline of 
        events from the patterns found in the percentage graph. It would be interesting to see the slumps and peaks of each reference depending on the major event happening at 
        that time. As mentioned in the methodology, our social tag could be too broad to hold a lot of value, so breakingt that up into more specific references would prove 
        beneficial in the future.</p>
