        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>The goal of this project was to observe the differing topics presidents discussed in their inaugural addresses. We wanted to know what topic was relevant in politics 
        at the given time of these addresses. We read through all of the addresses and marked the sections of spectches containing references to war, diplomacy, economy, religion, 
        and social issues. Following this, we would need to create a website to display and discuss our findings.</p>
