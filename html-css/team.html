        <ul>
            <li><b>John Doe</b> is a junior pursuing a degree in Wildlife Management Studies. In his spare time, he manages wildlife, and enjoys long, moonlit walks on the beach, preferably in the company of wildlife, except for seagulls, because seagulls are just awful. This course was his first brush with coding, and it has left him traumatized for life.</li>
